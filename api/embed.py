docs = ["Chinas carbon emissions will likely hit a new record in 2023 on the back of an economic rebound, but a rapid expansion in green energy will enable its emissions to peak soon, a global energy think tank said on Friday. China, the worlds largest emitter of greenhouse gas, saw its carbon dioxide emissions rise 4% in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2022, reaching more than 3 billion tonnes, according to a new report by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) for Carbon Brief. Thats the highest first-quarter number on record. The increase was driven by an economic rebound after the end of Chinas zero-Covid policy, economic stimulus measures and weak hydro generation due to an ongoing drought, the Helsinki-based think tank said. Looking at the rest of the year, the governments focus on economic growth means that Chinas emissions are likely to reach an all-time high in 2023, topping the previous peak in 2021,” said Lauri Myllyvirta and Qi Qin, analysts at CREA. However, the emissions could peak soon, as China has accelerated its clean energy push and installed record amounts of solar and wind power capacity, the analysts pointed out. The rapid expansion in low-carbon energy, if sustained, could enable emissions to peak and enter structural decline, once the post-Covid recovery has played out, they said. China’s economy rebounded in the first quarter of 2023, with GDP growth accelerating to 4.5%, according to official statistics released last month. The government previously set a growth target of “around 5%” for 2023, although many investment banks have raised their forecasts to above 5.5%. Coal production surge The largest contributor to rising emissions was electricity generation. Power output from coal increased by 2% from a year ago, the report showed. Coal is the main source of energy in China and is widely used for heating, power generation and steelmaking. The country has ramped up coal production since last summer when the worst heatwave and drought in decades hit hydroelectricity, the countrys second biggest source of power. Coal production surged 11% in 2022 from 2021, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. To boost coal imports, China scrapped its restrictions on Australian coal earlier this year, effectively ending an unofficial ban that lasted for more than two years. In the first quarter, Chinas total imports of coal soared 96% from a year earlier. Commuters cross an intersection in the central business district during the morning rush hour in Beijing, Tuesday, April 18, 2023. Chinas economy shakes off Covid legacy to grow 4.5% in Q1 The second biggest reason for rising emissions was the higher production volumes of construction materials, mainly steel and cement, the CREA analysts said. Thats mainly because of government stimulus measures for the manufacturing and construction industries. Emissions are likely to grow this year, the analysts said, as the government is pursuing a broad-based approach to economic recovery that seeks to boost exports, manufacturing output and construction, in addition to consumption. This will lead to a sharp increase in bank lending and investment, particularly for manufacturing, transportation and energy production, they added. aiib president Jin Liqun China is committed to net zero, head of top Asian development bank says at COP27 However, China still sees clean energy as its future. President Xi Jinping restated his vision for a green and beautiful China in February and called for an energy revolution to achieve carbon neutrality in the longer term. Solar installations increased to a record 34 gigawatts (GW) in the first three months of the year, nearly tripling the previous high of 13GW in the same period of 2022, according to latest figures released by the National Energy Administration. New wind power installations also reached a record high. The 10.4GW added in the three months to March 2023 was an increase of 32% over the period in 2022, the NEA figures showed. These sources of power, including renewables and nuclear, exceeded 50% of Chinas installed power capacity in the first quarter, overtaking fossil fuel-based capacity for the first time in history, the CREA analysts said. When low-carbon power growth matches — and then exceeds — the annual increase in electricity demand, the sectors CO2 emissions will peak, they said.",
"A Chinese warplane fired flares in front of a Canadian military helicopter over international waters of the South China Sea last Sunday, an operation that Canadian military officers said was reckless and could have resulted in the downing of the aircraft. “The risk to a helicopter in that instance is the flares moving into the rotor blades or the engines so this was categorized as both unsafe and non-standard, unprofessional,” said Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, the warship from which the Sikorsky Cyclone helicopter was flying. The incident was the second of two encounters the Ottawa’s helicopter had with Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy J-11 fighter jets over international waters on October 29, which saw the fighters get as close as 100 feet from the helicopter, Millen told CNN in an interview aboard the warship. He said that Canada and other nations have seen Chinese aircraft get close to fixed-wing aircraft on numerous occasions, but it was rare to see such action taken against a helicopter. The first incident was over international waters outside of 34 miles from the Paracel Island chain in the northern part of the South China Sea. The second was also over international waters outside of 23 miles from the Paracels. The warship was operating in international waters 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of the Paracels at the time. The Canadian helicopter was searching for a previously detected submarine when the incidents occurred, officers aboard the Ottawa said. Millen said he was piloting the Canadian helicopter earlier in the day, when Chinese J-11s intercepted it at close range while it flew straight and level at 3,000 feet above the water back toward the Ottawa, a signal to that it had no hostile intent.

Andrew Vaughan/The Canadian Press/AP/File In that earlier encounter, Millen said the Chinese fighters flew in circles around his helicopter. “When the intercepting aircraft was closer and closer, at a certain point it became unsafe,” he said. His helicopter experienced turbulence coming off the Chinese jets, also posing a danger to the copter, Millen said. “I certainly am not as comfortable as you can be based on the fragility of the rotor system,” he said. Millen said he ended that encounter by descending to 200 feet, an area where the helicopter can operate but is “very uncomfortable for fast air fighter jets.” The Canadian air force major said his military’s air crews train on how to respond to such intercepts as occurred on Sunday and will continue to fly over the international waters of the South China Sea. Asked about the interception at a regular press briefing on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.” “We have reiterated many times our firm position on Canadian warplanes conducting reconnaissance near Chinas territorial airspace,” he told reporters. “We hope Canada will refrain from its inappropriate behavior to avoid the situation from becoming more complicated.” CNN has also reached to China’s Defense Ministry for comment. China claims historic jurisdiction over almost the entirety of the vast South China Sea, and since 2014 has built up tiny reefs and sandbars into artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems – sparking outcry from the other claimants. The Paracels, called the Xisha Islands by China, are in the northern part of the South China Sea, east of Da Nang, Vietnam, and south of China’s Hainan Island.

Heres why it matters for the world The 1.3-million-square-mile waterway is vital to international trade, with an estimated third of global shipping worth trillions of dollars passing through each year. It’s also home to vast fertile fishing grounds upon which many lives and livelihoods depend. In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. China has ignored the ruling. Freedom of navigation Major western powers frequently conduct passage across the sea in order to assert that the region is international waters, sparking Beijings ire. The Ottawa had been patrolling the waterway since last Monday, at times operating with United States, Australian, Japanese and New Zealand naval vessels and aircraft in a multinational exercise dubbed Noble Caribou. However, it was operating alone when the encounters with the Chinese jets. The Ottawa and the US Navy destroyer USS Rafael Peralta overnight Wednesday into Thursday local time continued their deployment into the Taiwan Strait, another international waterway and vital shipping channel that has seen tense encounters between PLA and allied vessels. See how close Chinese fighter jet came to US bomber 01:01 - Source: CNN Last June, the US Navy reported a close encounter between the destroyer USS Chung-Hoon and a Chinese warship during a Taiwan Strait transit, in which the US warship slowed down to avoid colliding with the Chinese navy vessel that cut in front of it. The Canadian frigate HMCS Montreal was accompanying the US ship at the time, and a news crew aboard it recorded the incident. Then Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu blamed the US for ratcheting up tensions in the region when questioned by reporters at a defense conference in Singapore. “They are not here for innocent passage, they are here for provocation,” Li said of US warships. Li said if the US and other foreign powers did not want confrontation, they should not send their military assets near China. “Mind your own business,” Li said, adding, “Why did all these incidents happen in areas near China, not in areas near other countries?” This week’s passage of the allied warships through the strait was uneventful, however, with no contact reported.

U.S. INDO-PACIFIC COMMAND/Reuters/File Sundays incidents come after other reports of unsafe intercepts of allied aircraft in the recent days. On Tuesday, a PLA fighter jet came within 10 feet of a US Air Force B-52 bomber flying over the South China Sea, the US military said. And earlier in October, a Chinese fighter jet came within five meters (16 feet) of a Canadian CP-140 reconnaissance and surveillance plane over the East China Sea. That incident was recorded by news crews aboard the Canadian aircraft and witnessed by Maj. Gen. Iain Huddleston, the commander of Canada’s 1st Air Division, who was also on the plane. Huddleston called the intercept “unprofessional” and “very aggressive” in a report from Radio Canada, which was on the plane. “The Canadian aircraft was subject to multiple close-proximity manoeuvres by a PLAAF aircraft that put the safety of all personnel at risk,” Canada’s Defense Ministry said in a statement. Philippine Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro talks during an interview with CNN in Manila, Philippines on September 29, 2023. Exclusive: Philippine defense secretary vows to stand up to ‘bully’ China China’s Foreign Ministry said the Canadian plane illegally entered Chinese airspace and accused the Canadian military of sending “warplanes halfway around the world to stir up trouble and make provocations at China’s doorsteps.” In February, in an incident witnessed by a CNN crew, a Chinese fighter jet came within 500 feet of a US Navy reconnaissance plane flying at 21,500 feet about 30 miles from the Paracels. Earlier this month, the Pentagon’s top official in charge of security in the Indo-Pacific, Ely Ratner, said that the US has seen more instances of “coercive and risky” behavior from Chinese pilots against US aircraft in the last two years over the East and South China Seas than in the entire decade before that. “Since the fall of 2021, we have seen more than 180 such incidents,” Ratner said. “It’s a centralized and concerted campaign to perform these risky behaviors in order to coerce a change in lawful US operational activity.",
"China and Australia are proof that governments do not have to like each other to do business. When Anthony Albanese arrives in China on Saturday, he will be the first Australian prime minister to visit in seven years. His three-day trip comes in the wake of plummeting relations between the two countries - and Canberra's growing military ties with Washington. In recent years Australia and China have accused each other over human rights violations and perceived threats to national security. Public perceptions of the other side are more negative than they have ever been. But when it comes to trade, they cannot afford to let go of each other. At the peak of their trading relationship in 2020, almost half of Australia's exports went to China. By way of comparison, at around the same time roughly 9% of all US exports and only 5% of British exports were being sold to China. Australia needs China This kind of leverage can be a powerful tool if a government wants to make a point, which is what happened in 2020 when Australia called for an independent inquiry into the origins of Covid-19. That was deeply upsetting to the Chinese government, said Jane Golley, an economist at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra. Australia and China eye new ways to heal old wounds Shortly after, the [Chinese] ambassador here gave a speech and suggested that some Australian industries might suffer as a consequence. Sure enough, a string of Chinese tariffs and restrictions followed on an estimated $20bn (£16.4bn) worth of Australian goods. Among the many products affected were barley, beef, wine, coal, timber and lobster. Basically the Chinese government was sending a message. They were unhappy with the Australian government and decided to use economic coercion to make that point, Professor Golley added. An employee works as Australian-made wine (on display shelves on R) are seen for sale at a store in Beijing on August 18, 2020. IMAGE SOURCE,GETTY IMAGES Image caption, Australian wine was one the targets of Chinese tariffs in a bitter trade war At the time, such a robust move from an important trading partner was a surprise to many. Since then, China has reversed many of the restrictions. The decision to row back on the tariffs was, at least partly, helped by a change of tack from the newly elected Australian government. Shortly after meeting with China's leader Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Bali last year, Mr Albanese said: We're always going to be better off when we have dialogue and are able to talk constructively and respectfully. What Chinas economic problems mean for the world The laidback Australian city key to countering China He reminded Australians that trade with China was worth more than with Japan, the US and South Korea combined. Clearly, normalising relations between what he called two highly complementary economies would be a priority for his government. Whether Chinas so-called economic coercion was successful is doubtful. Australia is still openly critical of Beijing on several fronts - but there is no question that Australian businesses and workers took a hit because of Chinas trade restrictions. We cant live without them, essentially, Professor Golley said. I think the Albanese government clearly decided that our economic links were too important to sacrifice and went for an improvement in our diplomacy. China needs Australia Australia has its own levers it can use to its advantage - especially when it comes to natural resources. China and Australia are deeply economically interdependent, said Benjamin Herscovitch, a research fellow at the ANUs National Security College. Typically, China has been, and still is, highly reliant on Australia for raw materials to satisfy its vast and growing economy. Huge amounts of its iron ore and liquefied natural gas, for example, come from Australia. Incidentally, neither of these commodities were subjected to Chinese restrictions. The Chinese public can live without Australian wine and lobsters, but until the country is able to adequately source materials to make steel or power its factories, Beijing knows it is not in a strong position to start making demands of Australia.

Some analysts argue that Chinas trade restrictions were not forcing Canberra closer to Beijing - rather they had the opposite effect. The Chinese government started to realise that its coercive economic and diplomatic measures were driving Australia closer to the United States, said Mr Herscovitch. Beijings decision to remove trade restrictions and normalise diplomatic contact is aimed at wooing Canberra away from Washington. One aim could be to gain Australian support for entry into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). How US Marines are being reshaped for China threat This is the successor to the doomed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) - the free trade agreement from which then-US President Donald Trump withdrew. So far several countries, including Australia, have blocked Chinas attempts to join. To be blunt, China doesnt have that many friends in the world. We used to be one, but not anymore, Professor Golley said. If you think about it, it makes sense to have a strong economic relationship with an ally of the United States. If youre being cynical, it gives you an opportunity to drive a wedge between us and Washington. Having their cake and eating it Given the heightened tensions with the US, it makes sense that China does not want to alienate Americas allies. Not only is Washington trying to exclude China from access to technology needed for advanced computer chips and critical minerals needed for green energy, it is also putting pressure on its allies to do the same. Half of the worlds lithium, for example, is in Australia. Chinese companies want access to such metals that are crucial for making electric vehicles, a field in which China is currently the global leader. President Joe Biden and Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese toast before the start of the state dinner to the White House on October 25, 2023 in Washington, DC IMAGE SOURCE,GETTY IMAGES Image caption, Mr Albanese was in Washington recently to meet Mr Biden According to Professor Golley, there is a danger that Australia and China become competitors rather than collaborators when it comes to issues they need to work together on, such as fighting climate change. Australias close political and military ties with the US mean it will inevitably fall on the American side of the superpower struggle. But siding with a country whose economic policies actively harm China will only put more strain on the relationship and could risk landing both countries back at square one. I dont know how much longer this can continue, said Professor Golley. The Australian government wants a relationship with China in which, basically, we continue to export to them as normal." "But at the same time we also diversify away from them and restrict their capital flows into the country. To me, that sounds like we want to have our cake and eat it too."]
