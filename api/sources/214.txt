Ohio voters on Tuesday were projected to reject “Issue 1,” a ballot measure making it more difficult to amend the state constitution. The special election galvanized both supporters and critics of the ballot initiative, as the outcome affects a November vote on whether to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. Here’s a look at what Issue 1 would have done, and what its rejection could mean for abortion in Ohio.
Tracking abortion access in the United States: Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the legality of abortion has been left to individual states. The Washington Post is tracking states where abortion is legal, banned or under threat. 
Abortion pills: The court battle over the abortion pill mifepristone, which is part of a two-drug regimen used to terminate early pregnancy, is ongoing. The Supreme Court now has the opportunity to rule on when and how mifepristone can be prescribed and distributed after the Justice Department asked the high court to overturn a lower-court ruling limiting access to the pill. For now, full access to mifepristone will remain in place after a Supreme Court ruling in the spring.
Post-Roe America: With Roe overturned, women who had secret abortions before Roe v. Wade felt compelled to speak out. Other women who were seeking abortions while living in states with strict abortion bans also shared their experiences with The Post through calls, text messages and other documentation. Here are photos and stories from across America since the reversal of Roe v. Wade.
